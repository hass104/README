Logical Equivalence Checker

Overview
This project is a Java application that checks if two compound propositions are logically equivalent. The program evaluates both propositions by generating their truth tables and compares the truth values for all possible combinations of variables (A, B, C). Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) and parentheses are supported.
